# Linguistic diversity

### Outline
Sentiment toward immigration/ immigrants
- H1: The lower/more negative the sentiment toward immigrants, the lower the linguistic diversity on Twitter

- H2: The greater the rate of immigration, the lower the sentiments toward immigrants and immigration

- H3: Places with longer histories of immigration will show more positive sentiment toward immigration
  - H3a: "Lower" job/employment rates have a negative effect on Twitter sentiment in areas with shorter immigrant histories
  - H3b: "Higher" employment rates will not influence sentiments in areas regardless of immigrant histories
